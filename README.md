<h1 align="center" id="title">Indoor Navigation using Augmented Reality</h1>

<p id="description">This project creates a navigation system inside the institution using augmented reality (AR) technology. By leveraging AR capabilities, we enhanced the navigation and wayfinding experiences for students, teachers, and visitors on the university campus. We provide customers with accurate and instantaneous location tracking using augmented reality (AR) technology so they can move easily between different buildings, offices, classes, and services. We combined digital elements with the actual world using augmented reality to design a fun and dynamic navigation experience. Due to consumers' ability to instantly view AR overlays on their mobile devices, such as directional indicators, signage, and points of interest, navigation will be easier and more user-friendly. By incorporating AR technology, we created a seamless and efficient navigation experience that boosts user satisfaction, simplifies wayfinding, and promotes a technologically advanced environment. </p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   The app uses the user's mobile phone camera to scan QR codes that are placed across the institution and when a particular QR code is scanned it allows the system to know the current location of the user.
*   The user can select the destination which they want to visit through the app and an AR arrow will help the user navigate to their destination.
*   It can be used to navigate multiple floors therefore it can also be used in malls airports hospitals and other large institutions with multiple floors.
*   No special hardware is required.
*   Greater accuracy when compared to GPS navigation.
